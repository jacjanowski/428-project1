# Project 1: Mergecube and Classcube 

## Project Description
This project focuses on the creation of two models that have two different approaches to them. With different designs to them, the main focus is to understand how to work with these models and customize them with materials while creating our own as well.

## Versions
Unity 2019.4.28f - [https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2019.4.28](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2019.4.28)

## Installation
Create an empty directory with the name of your choosing and go into it. From there do the following in order to clone it.
```
git clone https://github.com/jacjanowski/428-project1.git
```
Once done, open the project inside of Unity. Make sure you have the right version of Unity and Vuforia. Inside of Unity, make sure to link Vuforia to Unity by going to 'Tools -> Build Settings -> Vuforia Configuration'. From there, on the right hand side there will be an area to 'Add License Key'. Paste in the license key that came with the Vuforia download page. Sign in, and 'Get License Key' from the top of the navbar on the website. Copy to clipboard and paste it in. Your project is now linked to Vuforia. Everything else is set and ready to use, so simply click the 'Play' button at the top middle page. Make sure your webcam is connected (it will auto-detect if so).
